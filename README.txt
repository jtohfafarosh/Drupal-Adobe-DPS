INTRODUCTION
------------
Herein you will find the now-deprecated DPSBridge module, which integrates 
Drupal with Adobe DPS. This module is now at end of life as a new AdobeDPS 
is being introduced to the market, and consequently a new and better DPSBridge 
module has been created. You can find that in sandbox on drupal.org. 

A note that you use this module at your own risk. It is no longer supported.

This older DPSBridge module converts selected articles into HTML stacks and then
uploads the articles directly to Adobe DPS Folio Producer by utilizing the Folio
Producer APIs. In addition, DPSBridge compares each selected Drupal article with
the version in the folio and indicates when the content is out of sync. An
authorized user can then update the contents of the folio to utilize the most
current version of the Drupal article.

The DPSBridge Module allows you to work within Drupal to:

 * Create a new HTML Folio for Adobe DPS
 * Search for and select articles for publishing to Adobe DPS
 * Add and remove HTML articles from a folio
 * Convert images associated with a Drupal node to a slideshow in the HTML
   article
 * Assign your own CSS to style the resulting HTML article
 * Reorder articles contained within an HTML Folio
 * Compare Drupal article content to that which has been uploaded to Folio
   Producer with the option to update the folio articles to keep the content in
   sync (for Adobe DPS Enterprise customers)
 * Clone a folio to create a copy of the selected folio and all article
   references (useful when publishing the same content to multiple marketplaces)
 * Upload article content directly to Folio Producer (for Adobe DPS Enterprise
   customers; requires no interaction with Adobe InDesign)
 * Automatically generate a Cover article and Table of Contents article if
   desired
